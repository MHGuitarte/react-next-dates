# Portal

Popper use [react-popper](https://github.com/popperjs/react-popper) for positioning.

Default, Popper is render inside Picker components. It can cause container overflowing issues.

To prevent this, React Next Dates Popper can use a react portal to render his content.

To do this, all pickers have a `portalContainer` props.

```tsx
<DatePicker locale={fr} portalContainer={document.body}>
  {({ inputProps }) => <input {...inputProps} />}
</DatePicker>
```

> NB: This feature is use on all stories components to prevent overflow inside StoryBook containers.
